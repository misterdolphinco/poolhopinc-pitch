## Questions

 Q: What is the narrative thrust of the story? Please include basic plot points, conflict, potential characters, etc., as if it were a movie.  

A: So I’ll introduce myself,
My name is Andrew Corrado - or just Andy, I’m currently going into my final year as graphic design student in Toronto. 

- - - -

Let’s get into it then,
On a hot summers day my girlfriend and I were going for a walk around the neighbourhood and as we walked I could smell the pungent scent of chlorine in the air. I knew someone in the area had a pooling their backyard just from that scent alone. I thought to myself “Who knows? Maybe a few more people have pools around here too.” 

- - - -

At this point, I had this awfully bitter taste in my mouth that wouldn’t go away - it wasn’t the chlorine though…
I thought, “huh, this area is mostly occupied by pretty above middle class citizens for a extremely middle class area.” “Do these people even use their pool at this hour? It’s Saturday and all the cars are out of the driveway. ”

I know most of these houses have garages too, but most people in this area will leave their car out during any season besides winter.

Let me give you a brief recap here of what’s happening:

You have residential homes owned by families with in-ground pools that  for the most part, work full-time 9-5 hours. What’s the pool doing during those hours?

The answer is nothing… besides putting a dent into your electric bill and gathering dead bugs.

- - - -

Some of these people even pay a third-party to clean the pool once a week for them while they’re at work - but the pool is never really dirty enough to need a proper cleaning. 

Pool Hop can help you subsidize the cost of a weekly pool cleaning by sharing your pool with some friendly strangers. Yes, they are strangers who will reward you for simply allowing them to be a guest in your backyard.
There’s more to it than that though.
What if you clean your own pool? Can you still rent your pool to guests and just pocket some extra cash while your busy at work? 

Yes.

**Pool Hop makes it easy and accessible to rent out and book a personal pool.** With grouping that supports up to 8 ID’d and verified users, Pool Hop makes the “Group Hop” sharing experience safe and secure. 

The features that make Pool Hop safe and secure are also embedded into the core iPhone app, which allows “Hoppers” to enable their camera to take randomized burst shots of the pool area during the span of one hour. 

These photos will be facially processed headcounts of Hoppers who are using the pool area, no descriptive visual imagery will be sent directly to the “Pool Host” unless the headcount exceeds a set limit based upon the number of Hoppers given permission to access the property. As a safety and privacy concern Pool Hop Hosts must agree upon personal surveillance black out periods during the span of any Hoppers visits. Each camera must be visibly  covered with a cloth or black plastic bag. 

Additionally Hoppers will be encouraged to always exercise agreed upon rules before they can sign up to use the service. There will be a series of agreements and notices, along with a short video about how to use the safety features while on a Hosts property, such as: The 2-Tap Emergency Services feature (during Hoppers stay), Apple Maps Integration For Directions, & a short list of generalized pool-use guidelines which can be modified by each Host, but retains commonality throughout the experience.

Pool Hop would like to incorporate other services that work well with our own, such as Apple Music & Spotify for streaming music, Uber & Lyft for transportation, Sonos & Logitech speakers for wireless music integration, and Phillips & Belkin for control of automated lighting / switch systems. 

### Plot Points: 

```
Student of Design Looks To Secure A Future -- Visual Experimentation -- Greater Understanding of Life As Age Progresses -- Late Night Power Sessions of Thoughts & Idea Exploration -- Lots of Coffee & Some Luck -- Introduction To Pool Hop & I (above) -- The Quest To Be Weightless & Cool Inside Someone Elses Pool (legally) -- Explanation of Product & Uses. ++REFINE++

 Q: What are the broader questions, ideas, and/or issues about music that arise from that narrative?   

A: Good integration between wireless speaker systems and streaming music services is quite rare in the current state of iPhone App Store. People rarely take full advantage of their outdoor audio systems. If the great sound quality of an installed home audio systems is demonstrated to a large enough group of people, it could marginally increase brand awareness of said audio systems, increasing sales in the process. Examples include, but are not limited to: Sonos, Logitech, Bose, JBL, Pioneer and Marley. A working partnership with these brands could also facilitate a mutually beneficial ad campaign run for both services sold at once. Starting with one brand partnership, campaigns can be featured audibly on Spotify, Pandora, and visually with the help of Instagram, Twitter & Facebook with the potential of in-house marketing assistance from the speaker manufacturers.

 Q: What’s your access to potential characters? Which potential characters have you spoken to?  

A: No one as of yet. But, I have potential positions available that will most definitely require some capitol to retain. Right now, this is still mostly just a idea, but due to the research and development I’ve achieved on my own, I feel that a good development plan can be put into the works with the right team who have just as much conviction to Pool Hop as I do.

 Q: Why are you the best person to report this story?  

A: I’m the founder.
